As noted in the the subtitle, shab-pimd is a simple Path Integral Molecular Dynamics simulation created to compare various thermostatting and variable transformation methods. It was written by Emily (S)hiavone, Timon (H)ilker (a)nd Ethan (B)rown as a final project for UIUC's PHYS 466 Atomic Scale Simulations course in the spring of 2011.
